- 👋 Hi, I’m @Boontai an aspiring developer and family man.
- 👀 I’m interested in spending time with my son. Besides that gaming on minecraft or diablo 4, cooking and fishing.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning laravel 8 from laracasts, notepad++ is an amazing tool.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating some projects to use what I'm learning, currently it would be PHP/front-end projects such as creating websites or apps but I am still learning.
- 📫 How to reach me! Either devynwtrigg@gmail.com or @boontai on discord.
